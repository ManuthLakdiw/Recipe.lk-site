            <h3>Gotukola Sambol (Pennywort Salad)</h3>
            <p>
              Green leafy vegetables aren’t the most common thing to eat in Sri
              Lanka, though the cooking does call for many tuberous vegetables.
              But anyway, since I love green veggies, I ate a dish known as
              Gotukola Sambol, frequently during my visit. Gotukola is the word
              for Asiatic pennywort, a small leafy green vegetable that’s common
              throughout southeast Asia. Sambol is the word used to describe a
              dish or garnish that prepared and eaten using raw ingredients. So
              gotukola sambol is a basically Sri Lankan salad garnish.

              Light, crisp, and refreshing, Carrot Salad is a simple yet
              flavorful dish that adds a fresh touch to any meal. Made with
              thinly sliced or grated carrots, it is often combined with fresh
              coconut, lime juice, and a hint of spice to create a perfect
              balance of sweetness and tanginess. Whether served as a side dish
              or enjoyed on its own, this vibrant salad brings a delicious
              crunch and a burst of natural flavors, making it a delightful
              addition to Sri Lankan cuisine.
