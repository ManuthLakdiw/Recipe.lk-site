                <h4>Gotukola Sambol (Pennywort Salad)</h4>
                <p>
                  Green leafy vegetables aren’t the most common thing to eat in
                  Sri Lanka, though the cooking does call for many tuberous
                  vegetables. But anyway, since I love green veggies, I ate a
                  dish known as Gotukola Sambol, frequently during my visit.
                  Gotukola is the word for Asiatic pennywort, a small leafy
                  green vegetable that’s common throughout southeast Asia.
                  Sambol is the word used to describe a dish or garnish that
                  prepared and eaten using raw ingredients. So gotukola sambol
                  is a basically Sri Lankan salad garnish.

                <p>
                  Light, crisp, and refreshing, Carrot Salad is a simple yet
                  flavorful dish that adds a fresh touch to any meal. Made with
                  thinly sliced or grated carrots, it is often combined with
                  fresh coconut, lime juice, and a hint of spice to create a
                  perfect balance of sweetness and tanginess. Whether served as
                  a side dish or enjoyed on its own, this vibrant salad brings a
                  delicious crunch and a burst of natural flavors, making it a
                  delightful addition to Sri Lankan cuisine.
